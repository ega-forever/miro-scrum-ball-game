# Scrum ball game rules

## General information
The game represents the scrum simulation. In current game implementation there are 3 roles:
1) Developer team member
2) Product owner
3) Scrum master

All 3 roles are the same as in original scrum guide. The first user, who starts the game - becomes PO, the
rest (who join the game) - are developer team members.

## How to start the game
To run game, click on darts icon (in bottom bar). The popup window should appear. To start the game click "start game as PO".
The first user, who starts the game - becomes PO.

The game should create 3 buckets:
1) yellow - source bucket, from which you can obtain a ball
2) green - the target bucket (where the ball should be put, once everyone will touch it)
3) red - the draw bucket. If ball has been loosed, it will be moved automatically to the draw bucket

## Roles
There are 3 roles: developer, PO (product owner) and scrum master
1) PO: this person is response for passing balls from source bucket to developers. He can do this by moving blue ball on developer's sticker
2) developer: each developer has his own sticker (with written name on it). The ball should be moved between stickers.
3) Scrum master: This is the facilitator role. As game is limited in time (rounds), the scrum master should track the time and team performance

## Rules
1) Only PO can move balls from source bucket to developer's sticker
2) Only the sticker owner (the owner's developer name should be written on the sticker) can move ball from his sticker to another sticker
3) Each time a new developer touch the ball (the ball moves to a new sticker) - the count of touches on the ball is updated
4) Once all developers touched the ball, any developer can move the ball to target bucket
5) The developer's sticker can hold only one ball at a time!

## How to play?
1) start the game
2) make sure, that rest of the users joined the game
2) The scrum master should add timer and count down 2 minutes
3) ask the team (PO + developers) to put as much balls as they can into the target bucket in 2 minutes
4) after 2 minutes - scrum master should stop the team and timer, check how many balls reached the target bucket and draw bucket, make retrospective
5) fix the results in table (for instance in excel)
5) click on darts button again, then "reset scores"
6) start the game again. It's okey to have 3-5 rounds
7) After each round make retrospective. The team should adopt over time, and scores result should increase

## How to start new game
To restart the game, you can follow several scenarios:
1) the PO should press the button "reset scores"
2) Anyone can remove buckets and PO card from the board, then click "start new game as PO"
3) the PO can press "stop the game" - and the board will be cleaned from game elements (i.e. buckets, stickers)
